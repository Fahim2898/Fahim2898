** Read the user-story and write java code with the help of Inheritance concept. Upload your java files.
In Hotel Sea-Crown, there are 40 rooms, among them, 10 rooms are deluxe rooms and 30 rooms are standard rooms.
All hotel rooms have the common fields room-id and customer-id who has rented the room. But the deluxe room has

who rented the room has common attributes - Id, name.

•Implement inheritance on only those classes which are needed to be inherited.              
•Explain what the benefit you got by using encapsulation and inheritance in your code.
